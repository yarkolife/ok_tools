Installation & Deployment
=========================

OK Tools uses Docker for production deployment. The installation process consists of 5 steps:

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
::

    git clone https://github.com/Offener-Kanal-Merseburg-Querfurt/ok-tools.git
    cd ok-tools

**Step 2: Create Your Configuration**

Copy one of the configuration templates from ``deployment/configs/`` and customize it:
::

    cp deployment/configs/okmq.env.template deployment/configs/my-org.env.template
    # Edit deployment/configs/my-org.env.template and replace __REPLACE_ME__ placeholders

Available templates:
- ``okmq.env.template`` - OKMQ configuration template
- ``ok-bayern.env.template`` - Bayern configuration template
- ``ok-nrw.env.template`` - NRW configuration template

**Step 3: Add Logo and Favicon**

Place your organization's branding files in ``deployment/img/``:
::

    cp /path/to/your/logo.png deployment/img/logo.png
    cp /path/to/your/favicon.ico deployment/img/favicon.ico

**Step 4: Run Installation Script**
::

    chmod +x deployment/scripts/install.sh
    ./deployment/scripts/install.sh

The script will guide you through installation type selection (Production, Local Network, or Localhost) and create a production directory at ``../ok_tools_production``.

**Step 5: Update the Application**

After installation, updates are performed from the production directory:
::

    cd ../ok_tools_production
    ./update.sh

The update script automatically pulls the latest code from git, updates Docker containers, runs migrations, and restarts services.

See ``deployment/README.md`` for detailed installation instructions.

**Organization Configuration:**

The installation script will guide you through the configuration process. Configuration templates are located in ``deployment/configs/`` directory.

Key organization settings in the configuration file:
::

    # Organization Configuration
    ORG_NAME=Your Community Media Organization e.V.
    ORG_SHORT_NAME=Your CMO
    ORG_WEBSITE=https://your-organization.com
    ORG_EMAIL=info@your-organization.com
    ORG_ADDRESS=Your Address Here\nCity, Postal Code
    ORG_PHONE=+49 123 456789
    ORG_FAX=+49 123 456790
    ORG_DESCRIPTION=Welcome to our organization! We provide media services...
    ORG_OPENING_HOURS=Mon: 09:00 - 17:00\nTue-Fri: 09:00 - 18:00
    STATE_MEDIA_INSTITUTION=MSA
    ORG_ORGANIZATION_OWNER=Your CMO

**Note:** Use ``\n`` for line breaks in ``ORG_ADDRESS`` and ``ORG_OPENING_HOURS``. Organizations are created automatically on application startup.

**What Gets Created Automatically:**

When you configure ``state_media_institution`` and ``organization_owner``, the system automatically creates:

- **MediaAuthority** object (in ``/admin/registration/mediaauthority/``)
  - Your organization: "OK Bayern" (used for user profile association)
  
- **Organization** objects (in ``/admin/inventory/organization/``)
  - State institution: "BLM" (equipment accessible to all users)
  - Your organization: "OK Bayern" (equipment accessible only to members)

These objects are used for user profiles and equipment ownership/access control throughout the system.

**German State Media Institutions:**

The system supports all German state media institutions:

- **MSA** - Medienanstalt Sachsen-Anhalt
- **LFK** - Landesanstalt für Kommunikation Baden-Württemberg
- **BLM** - Bayerische Landeszentrale für neue Medien
- **mabb** - Medienanstalt Berlin-Brandenburg
- **brema** - Bremische Landesmedienanstalt
- **MA HSH** - Medienanstalt Hamburg / Schleswig-Holstein
- **MMV** - Medienanstalt Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
- **NLM** - Niedersächsische Landesmedienanstalt
- **LfM NRW** - Landesanstalt für Medien NRW
- **LMS** - Landesmedienanstalt Saarland
- **SLM** - Sächsische Landesmedienanstalt
- **TLM** - Thüringer Landesmedienanstalt

See the ``deployment/configs/`` directory for ready-to-use environment file templates for different German states.

**Note:** For Docker deployment, the `.env` file is automatically created in the production directory (``../ok_tools_production/.env``) during installation. The system will use your organization's branding throughout the interface, forms, and communications.

**Dependencies:**
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (via Docker)
- Redis (via Docker, for caching and Celery)
- Celery and Celery Beat (for background task processing)

All dependencies are automatically installed in Docker containers during deployment. The application uses Python 3.12+ and Django 5.2.7 inside the container.

Configuration
=============

Configuration is done via environment variables in `.env` file located in the production directory (``../ok_tools_production/.env``).

**Configuration Files:**
- `.env` file - Environment configuration file (created during installation)
- `deployment/configs/*.env.template` - Environment file templates for different organizations

Production Deployment
=====================

OK Tools uses Docker for production deployment.

**Docker Deployment:**

See ``deployment/README.md`` for comprehensive Docker setup instructions.

Quick start::

    git clone https://github.com/Offener-Kanal-Merseburg-Querfurt/ok-tools.git
    cd ok-tools
    # Copy and customize config template

    # Run installation
    chmod +x deployment/scripts/install.sh
    ./deployment/scripts/install.sh
    # For updates
    cd ../ok_tools_production
    ./update.sh

Data Import
============

**Legacy Data Import:**

It is possible to import legacy data from Excel files (:code:`.xlsx`).

The import functionality requires:
- A workbook with worksheets named: :code:`users`, :code:`contributions`, :code:`categories`, :code:`repetitions`, :code:`projects`
- Configure the path in :code:`settings.py` via :code:`LEGACY_DATA` (default: :code:`../legacy_data/data.xlsx`)

**Note:** The legacy import script is a one-time migration tool. If you've already completed your data migration, this feature is not needed for daily operations.

**Contributions Import (DISA):**

Import contributions from DISA export files (Excel format):
- Supports both XLSX and XLS file formats (automatic conversion)
- Date-based filtering (import from specific date onwards)
- Automatic primary/repetition detection
- Batch processing for performance
- AJAX date extraction for user convenience
- Validation of file structure and required worksheets

**Inventory Import:**

Privacy Policy
==============

Privacy policy content is resolved in this order:

1. If ``Organization Configuration -> Privacy Policy (Datenschutz)``
   (``/admin/registration/organizationconfig/1/change/``) is non-empty,
   this value is used.
2. If that field is empty, fallback file :code:`files/privacy_policy.html`
   is used.

The database field supports:

- Placeholder substitution (for example ``{{ OK_NAME }}``, ``{{ OK_ADDRESS }}``)
  using organization context values.
- Basic Markdown-style formatting (headings, lists, emphasis) for plain text
  input.
- Safe HTML rendering with a restrictive allowlist of tags/attributes.

Security
========
